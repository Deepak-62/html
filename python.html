<p>What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy 
text of the printing and typesetting industry
. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
 dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
 unknown printer took a galley of type 
and scrambled it to make a type specimen 
book. It has survived not only five 
centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
 It was popularised in the 1960s with the 
release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
 passages, and more recently with desktop 
publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
 including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that 
a reader will be distracted by the 
readable content of a page when looking 
at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
is that it has a more-or-less normal 
distribution of letters, as opposed to using
 'Content here, content here', making it look like
 readable English. Many desktop publishing p
ackages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum 
as their default model text, and a search fo
r 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites sti
ll in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
 over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes 
on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
